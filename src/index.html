    <h1>Watercolor is fun!</h1>
    <section class="text">
    <p>When it comes to paints, watercolors sometimes get a bad rap. They have the reputation of being unforgiving and unpredictable.

      It’s true that it can be difficult to correct mistakes with watercolors, and you sometimes have to be willing to go with the flow and let the paints do their own thing. However, the results of these “happy accidents” (to quote Bob Ross) are often breathtaking.</p>
      <p>When I decided to find a new creative outlet, I spent a lot of time considering which type of paint I wanted to use. After weighing the pros and cons of each, I decided on watercolors. There were several key advantages that swayed my decision. Here are few of the biggest benefits of watercolors versus oils or acrylics.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Easy Clean Up It is practically impossible to ruin your brushes with watercolor paints. If you forget to wash them, it is not a big deal. You can just rinse them out before you start painting the next time. There is no need to worry about dried paint hardening and ruining your brush. Also, if you get paint on your clothes, furniture or skin, it is easy to clean up with water.</li>
        <li>Less Wasted Paint If you are using watercolor in tubes and squeeze out too much paint, you don’t have to worry about the excess going to waste. Instead, just let the leftover paint dry on your palette and add water to it the next time you paint.</li>
        <li>Transparency From a purely visual standpoint, watercolor paint has an inner brilliance and clarity of color that is often lacking in other types of paint. This is largely due to the fact that it is transparent. Most paints reflect color directly off the surface of the paint.Watercolors, on the other hand, get their color as a result of light bouncing off the white paper and reflecting back up through the paint. As a result, the paintings almost look as if they are lit from within.This transparency also makes watercolors extremely versatile. A single tube or pan of watercolor paint can give you countless different shades of the same color simply by adding more or less water. You can build colors to add richness, or mix colors on the paper by layering one color over another.</li>
